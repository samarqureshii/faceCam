# TensorHealth: Post-Op Precision

## Project Description

This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms (TensorFlow Lite) to diagnose sepsis from facial symptoms in post-surgical patients. With an ESP32 microcontroller and a VC0706 camera, the system operates in real-time, capturing images and processing them to identify any visible signs of sepsis.

## Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues and organs. If not detected and treated promptly, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.

Sepsis can often be hard to detect in its early stages, and post-surgical patients are at a particularly high risk due to their weakened state and potential exposure to bacteria during surgery.

One of the earliest symptoms of sepsis is facial flushing or pale skin, which is where this project finds its application. The system we're developing aims to use image processing techniques on the ESP32 to detect these facial symptoms in real-time. Thus, potentially providing an early warning sign to healthcare professionals and allowing for a rapid response.

The use of the ESP32 microcontroller is due to its high performance, integrated WiFi, and compatibility with TensorFlow Lite, making it a perfect fit for deploying edge machine learning models. TensorFlow Lite allows us to use powerful machine learning models on device-constrained environments.

## The Problem

Existing diagnostic methods for sepsis rely on a combination of patient symptoms, blood tests, and imaging scans. However, these methods can be time-consuming, expensive, and require close monitoring by medical professionals.

With our project, we hope to provide an additional, more immediate tool for sepsis detection. By continuously analyzing facial symptoms in real-time, our system can provide an early warning sign, allowing for quicker medical intervention and potentially saving lives.
